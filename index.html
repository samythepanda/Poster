       A Snapchat score is a number associated with an individuals Snapchat account that reflects their in-app activity. While the score has no practical use, it adds gamification to the media-sharing app and incentivizes users to continue to communicate via Snapchat. The general rule for the system is one point for every snap you open or send. If you want to check your score,  go to your profile, and  to the right is your snap score.</h2>
	<h2>A secret trick that you might want to use is kind of simple. First you go to the search bar and type aaa, and add the person( probably a robot) with that username. Then type aaaa, aaaaa, aaaaaa, and etc. Once u have reached the limit of the pattern, you could to the same thing  with the letters b-z, if you wish to.  Once you are satisfied with the number of robots added, just take a picture, and send it to the robots.  The max people (or robots) you can send a snap to is 200.If you added 20 robots, your score would go up by 20 points. This method is useful and can make your score up fast in minutes! I used this trick and it has really helped me boost my snap score. Remember that you don't have to boost up your score all in one day, just take your time. It makes it so much easier when you don't have to do it all at once. If you look at the first picture, that was a screenshot of my score a few months ago, but then I recently took a screenshot and compared my score. It wasn't a huge difference, but that was because I didn't use the trick as often. I hope this trick helps you increase your score, happy snapping! </h2></h2>
